# ShowcaseCode Version Mecanum 
Code that FRC students should be able to study and learn the basics                           
It is assumed that you have read through the Nat/SimpleTankDrive and as a result some code has not been explained.
Check subsystems/DriveSubsystem for the mecanum explanation and example. 
Although this should be a working mecanum example, there are some more complex additions that can be added to this. Mainly, changing it so that it drives in Field Oriented mode. (This requires a gyroscope and most likely a PID controller.)
